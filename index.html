    <p>Finding the Right Medical Marijuana Strain for Your condition may sound a bit tricky.
    
 
    <p>Sativa, Indica, or Hybrid Strains ?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Indica strains are commonly used for reducing pain, relieving muscle tension, increasing relaxation, and helping patients rest.</p>
    <p>They are often recommended for nighttime use, because many patients find them helpful for promoting sleep.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sativa strains are popular for increasing energy levels, improving focus, and combatting depression. Sativa strains are often recommended for daytime use because many patients find them helpful for providing symptom relief without interfering with daily activities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Hybrid strains are varieties that contain similar levels of indica and sativa. These “best of both worlds” strains offer a balance between the benefits of both types.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It’s important to understand that these categories aren’t written in stone, but rather offer general guidance based on our experience with the product. Strainiac can help you find the right strain for you.</p>
